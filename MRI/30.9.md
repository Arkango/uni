# Relevance
Is subjective judgment
- Being on the proper subject
- Recent information
- Satisfy the goals of the user

Tenere conto di termini polisemici, o sinonimi.

Query macchina, ma serve cercare anche automobile o autoveicolo

Query pesca, parola con più significati

# Keyword search
- sample of relevance, the query sting appear verbatim in the document

- the query string appear frequently in the document, in any order

numero di occorrenze della parola va correlato con la lunghezza del documento

il messaggio all'interno del documento se ripetuto più volte rimane lo stesso messaggio no sale come rilevanza

# Intelligent IR
+ Taking into account the meaning of the words used.

+ Taking into account the order of words in the Query
+  Adapt to the user based on direct or indirect feedback .

#### Indicizzato
Testo manipolato ed ottimizzata per la ricerca


# IR System components
 - **text operations** forms index words
 - **indexing** construct an inverted index of word to document pointers
 - **searching** retrieves documents that contain a given query token from the inverted index.
 - **ranking** scores all retrieved documents according to a relevance metric. It also preform *grouping*


 Natural language processing - Machine learning

 # Natural language processing

 - Focused on the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic analysis of natural language text and discourse.

 - Ability to analyze syntax (phrase structure) and semantics coul allow retrieval based on *meaning* rather the Keywords .

NLP -> IR

- methods to determine sense of an abiguos words
- methods to identify specific pieces of information in a document
- methods for answering specific Nl questions


 # Machine learning
- Focused on improve computational system performance

- automated classification of examples based (supervised learning)

- automated methods for clustering unlabeled examples into meaningful groups (unsupervised learning)


# Retrieval models
- A retrieval model specifies the details of :
  - document representation
  - query representation
  - retrieval functions

- determines a notion of relevance

- notion of relevance can be binary or continuos

- ranking function: a funtion that assign scores to documents with regard to a given Query

# IR models
- An IR model is a quadruple [D,Q,F,R(q<sub>i</sub>,d<sub>j</sub>)]

 - D is a set of logical views for the documents in the collection
 - Q is a set of logical views for the user queries
 - F is a framework for modelling document and queries
 - R(q<sub>i</sub>,d<sub>j</sub>) is a ranking function

# Classes of retrieval model

- boolean models
- vector space models
- probabilistic models

# Common preProcessing steps

- strip unwanted characters/markup
- break into tokens
- stem tokens (keywords) on whitespace.
- stem tokens to "root" words
 - computational <br>
 Open problems:
 - errors
 - loss of context
 - stem still a word?


 Stemming ritorno alla radice della parola alle volte è necessario tornare solo fino al lemma

 # boolean model
 - a document is represented as a set of Keywords
 - queries and boolean expression of keywords
 connected with logical
expression

- output document is relevant or not. Not partial matches or ranking
